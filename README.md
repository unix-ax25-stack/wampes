# unix-ax25-stack

AX.25 networking for Unix — userspace and kernelspace, with connector to the outer world.

## The suite

- **libax25 / ax25apps / ax25tools** — the classic AX.25 library, applications, and tools
- **wampes** — a `net` derivative (ka9q nos) with a full userspace AX.25 stack

## What's new

The suite used to run on Linux only, tied to the in-kernel AX.25 stack. Today
*libax25* also runs without it (`--enable-userspace-ax25`) and talks directly
to WAMPES' userspace *net* stack — bringing AX.25 to other Unices for the
first time (tested on macOS). Kernel-mode AX.25 remains fully supported.

## Status

Proof of concept, in production on **DB0FHN** since August 2026. Testing and
bug reports are welcome; so are ideas — use GitHub Discussions.

## Background

The Linux AX.25 stack had numerous bugs and stability problems, and with
kernel 7.1 in-kernel AX.25 support is at risk of disappearing. A timely
solution was needed — this project provides one.

Concept and implementation took six weeks (from early August 2026). The suite
has been running on the modernized DB0FHN in production for two weeks and
received its first polish. There may still be bugs — all I have encountered
are fixed. Part of the development was non-trivial; without AI support and
long days this would probably still be in the planning stage.

## Configuration is trivial

The Unix side — `/etc/ax25/axports`:

```
wampes DB0FHN-10        9600    256     2       WAMPES node, port xnet
```

The WAMPES side — the essentials from `net.rc`:

```
ax25 mycall db0fhn-10
ip addr 44.130.60.101

atta tun ax25 1500 linux
route add 45.130.60.100 linux

atta axip xnet udp 930:9393 bind=127.0.0.1
ifc xnet encap ax25i mtu 1500
axip rou add db0fhn 127.0.0.1
```

That's it — a node on the air, bridged through WAMPES' AX.25 userspace stack,
with no kernel AX.25 involved. The complete, hardened example (incl. `ip learn`
and `listen ax25 add`) is in the folded section below. systemd startup:
`wampes/doc/linux-startup-systemd.txt`.

Please adjust /tcp/sockets for your needs.

After installing a new libax25, rebuild and relink the tools against it — the
library has changed a lot. Compile details incl. `--enable-userspace-ax25`:
`libax25/README.compile`. Further documentation: `libax25/doc`.

<summary><b>Connect demos</b> — live AX.25 calls via WAMPES</summary>

WAMPES knows the path to the igate:

```

GW4PTS AX.25 Connect v1.11
Trying...
*** Connected to igate
Rawmode
This is IGATE. Internetgatewaysystem for the Packet Radio Network.
```

Connect via WAMPES' `xnet` iface (note: `/etc/ax25/axports` need not know
`wampes:xnet`):

```
# call -r -s dl9sau-1 wampes:xnet igate
GW4PTS AX.25 Connect v1.11
Trying...
*** Connected to igate
Rawmode
This is IGATE. Internetgatewaysystem for the Packet Radio Network.
```

Loopback connect:

```
$ call -r -s dl9sau-1 wampes db0fhn-9
GW4PTS AX.25 Connect v1.11
Trying...
*** Connected to db0fhn-9

When the iface is specified explicitly (`wampes:xnet`), the assigned source
call is used:

```
wampes       DB0FHN-10   9600  256  2   WAMPES node, port xnet
wampes:xnet  DB0FHN-8    9600  256  2   WAMPES node, port xnet

<summary><b>AGWPE notes</b> — status & open questions</summary>

The AGWPE branch in libax25 was not pursued further, because the own protocol
to WAMPES is more promising and efficient. AGWPE is tested and works, e.g.
with direwolf as backend. Untested: AGWPE clients, and whether the
direwolf-backend or the AGWPE-client path to wampes works. Feedback is very
welcome.
